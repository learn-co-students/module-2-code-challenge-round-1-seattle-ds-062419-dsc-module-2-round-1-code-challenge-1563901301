0.25 point(s): Correctly use `ORDER BY` to sort results

0.25 point(s): Correctly use `DESC` to sort results in descending order

_Learning Goals: Order the results of your queries by using ORDER BY (ASC & DESC). Use Group By statements in SQL to apply aggregate functions like: COUNT, MAX, MIN, and SUM._
***
0.5 point(s): Correctly use a `JOIN` statement

0.5 point(s): Use the `JOIN` on the appropriate columns (`pokemon.type2` and `types.name`)

_Learning Goals: Query data using one-to-many and many-to-many joins._

0.25 point(s): Correctly use the `COUNT`, `MIN` and `MAX` aggregator
